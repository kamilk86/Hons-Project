all_marked.json contains all marked tweets (8270 tweets) with all marking labels e.g. 'negative', 'undecided' etc. 
I'm inlcuding this file just in case all tweets are needed

final_database.json is the final database that contains only xenphobic and non-xenophobic tweets (6085 tweets) with a single label 'negative'
which can be either true (2114 tweets) or false (3971 tweets)

Please note that some tweets do not contain location as no location was specified by the tweet author
