deport all foreign criminals,__label__2
detention centre then deport they are criminals they are not fleeing war of danger in france no foreign aid to countries that refuse to take them back we have a huge problem with grooming gangs jihadis they're they are next,__label__2

well astonishingly it's it is also very possible not to commit crimes while living in the uk being a law abiding citizen and hence avoiding deportation you know i cannot believe that they are supporting offenders and the uk is right to deport them if they legally can,__label__2
if someone breaks our laws and is not british deport them why should british people have to put up with them,__label__2

i’d rather use all funding to either keep them in jail permanently or deport them tbh,__label__2
deport them and their families,__label__2
instead of letting all these terrorists free after half their sentence 1 make them serve their full term 2 they must go before a board at the end of the sentence to see if they are fit to be released 3 if they are immigrants deport them on completion of their sentence,__label__2
deport them back to their own country where they their family originate from when sentences are served problem solved if they're they are not here they can't cannot commit acts of terror this requires gov grow a backbone balls cancel foreign aid to countries refusing to take them,__label__2

deport foreign criminals not fussed if they spend their time in brit or foreign jails we have no obligation to keep them here though once sentence completed esp when a fair amount of our prison pop are children of migrants or actually foreign born,__label__2
why the fuck are we still locking up cunts like this for 3 5 or 10 years for terroism related offences and thinking they will be rehabilitated just deport them ffs first strike and your out they can't cannot stab people when they are not in the country,__label__2

2/2 however you take a big chance when you let immigrant labour flood in even those with apparent qualifications it looks as if about 90% of what we are getting is the garbage and the dross,__label__2
1/2 clearly an experiment gone catastrophically wrong i believe the intention was to stop the uk population decline which was party due to our own indigenous population emigrating due to poor wages and oppression of the working class by bringing in cheap immigrant labour gt contd,__label__2
indeed i will suzy this immigrant hugging has forced my youngest son a tradesman to move to perth in oz if the wife didn't have dementia we'd sell up and join him the liberal looney left have turned the uk into a right shithole with their we welcome all immigrants naivety,__label__2
they drain more out of systems than they contribute to them so the we need immigration is a load of utter shite more consumers will boost an economy but not if they are claiming benefits it's it is a lose / lose,__label__2
it has been proved time and time again that immigrants even eu immigrants have not boosted anything other than the bank balances of the rich by keeping wages low for their workers all immigration has brought more patients into the system than health workers to cover them,__label__2
good it’s our nhs not free for all for every foreigner every foreigner should be made to pay for all non emergency treatment or prove they don’t have too it wasn’t built for health tourism it was built for us by us it’s simple don’t like it tough,__label__2

this dirty immigrant is a member of the greens but is certainly tempted to switch to labour because the current electoral system means my vote was wasted,__label__2
worth a watch the bigger picture of mass immigration how it helps no one,__label__2
why is wrong for the uk to want all immigration done via legal channels do you sleep with your front doors and windows open because if you don’t shut up,__label__2
does make you wonder why our immigration is so high if the country is so racist,__label__2
or of course a less fair immigration system,__label__2
citation that immigration in oecd countries creates a positive a positive of what exactly,__label__2
well actually most immigration in the uk creates a fiscal deficit this reduces living standards,__label__2
the government should focus on the poor people already here before importing millions more poor people immigration is a government policy like any other and should be to benefit citizens not leftwing special interest groups via,__label__2
my point was that and according to statistics as i've already mentioned new labour increased immigration deliberately because it knew migrants would become natural labour supporters and hopefully bring wealth by boosting the economy but it didn't quite go to plan because 2/,__label__2
immigration has been good but not all of it economic migrants who only wish to be on benefits and not work should not be allowed why do eu migrants who are unemployed anyway be allowed to claim here,__label__2
don’t be fooled say no to the refugees,__label__2
most of those child refugees are over 21 work it out,__label__2
think you missed the point it’s about unaccompanied child refugees not stopping children joining their parents who have legal status this stops a cruel tactic of unscrupulous parents smuggling kids illegally in the hope of joining them,__label__2
i take it there are mostly muslim refugees why can’t they go to other muslim country’s,__label__2

are the eu thick the reason for brexit was to bring back controlled immigration and stop free movement,__label__2
as we were already a sovereign nation with a sovereign parliament sovereign currency but with a government that had failed to use available resources to control immigration even that argument falls flat,__label__2
and mass uncontrolled immigration,__label__2
english are appalling linguists and have never controlled row immigration but in 2016 row migrants were net takers of 29 billion from economy,__label__2
no govt has controlled immigration successfully it has always been row immigration that has drained this country eg 2016 eu migrants contributed a net 20 billion but row migrants took 29b billion out now we will be stuck with the takers,__label__2
social cohesion - more control over immigration so that rapid changes in demographics and the cultural feel of areas can be managed more easily within the uk less competition for low paid jobs and more likelihood of better wage growth and a reduction in resentment t/w migrants,__label__2
nope in 2 years time we'll have as much immigration but it will be from other continents and will be hailed as part of a brilliant trade deal,__label__2
well said mate when the ruling elites have to live with the mass uncontrolled immigration they welcome in with no consent whatsoever from the public for it same public that have to lose homes hospital places etc to them only then will they'll begin to feel the enrichment,__label__2

how this rambling waffling leftie liberalist blathering clueless about nationhood ex indian immigrant got to become ceo of is beyond me,__label__2
immigration for any country is to support an ageing population those coming here to work have a mutually beneficial purpose when their taxes help the economy yet this is negated when mass immigration allows in those who are unemployable then immigrant tax payers also keep tbem,__label__2
the most curious thing about this kind of drossy islamic immigrant is how they have fled their despotic islamic-run shithole to impose themselves on us yet still fawn over the islamic shithole and it's it is slimy shithole leaders islam soleimani,__label__2
it is wrong i agree as translators are employed from the public purse that is why a new system for immigration is essential,__label__2

please take stringent action against this bigot rightwing hate monger seal his businesses deport him from malaysia for islamophobic comments incitement to hate calling for extermination of india’s muslims,__label__2
in your little woke bubble you seriously believe this and have no empathy for the thousands of women these overwhelmingly immigrant gangs have abused,__label__2
reducing population in developed countries gives space and resources for more immigration,__label__2

regarding the issue of immigrationi used to love meeting non brits now i'd i would love to have a day where i managed to have conversations in english because immigrants choose to speak english i now live in the former united kingdom city of edinburghit has a great acronym,__label__2
nothing racist about limiting immigration,__label__2
